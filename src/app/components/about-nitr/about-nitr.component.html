          There certainly was a good vision for Nigeria's food self-sufficiency goal when some 60 years ago, NITR was established to research and develop scientific and technological tools to control and eradicate Trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness in man, nagana/sammor√© in cattle), the No. 1 poverty disease of sub-Saharan African countries that is transmitted by tsetse flies. By 1975, NITR's mandate on Trypanosomiasis was expanded to include Onchocerciasis (river blindness) which is transmitted by black flies.
